# "He/She" to "They"
Userscript to turn any instance of "He/She" on a web page to "They"

## What does it do?
This script replaces any instance of "He/She" or "He or She" to "They".

## How do I use this?
You will need a userscript manager. I recommend [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net).

Once you have Tampermonkey installed, follow the images below to install the script.
